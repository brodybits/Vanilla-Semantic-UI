# Vanilla Semantic UI

Vanilla Semantic UI removes the jQuery dependency from [Semantic](http://www.semantic-ui.com), a UI framework designed for theming.

Still in development, see progress in to do list below.

#### Key Features

* 50+ UI elements
* 3000 + CSS variables
* 3 Levels of variable inheritance (similar to SublimeText)
* Built with EM values for responsive design
* Flexbox friendly

Semantic allows developers to build beautiful websites fast, with **concise HTML**, **intuitive javascript**, and **simplified debugging**, helping make front-end development a delightful experience. Semantic is responsively designed allowing your website to scale on multiple devices. Semantic is production ready and partnered with frameworks such as **React**, **Angular**, **Meteor**, and **Ember**, which means you can integrate it with any of these frameworks to organize your UI layer alongside your application logic.

#### Browser Support

* Last 2 Versions FF, Chrome, Safari Mac
* IE 11+
* Android 4.4+, Chrome for Android 44+
* iOS Safari 7+
* Microsoft Edge 12+

Although some components will work in IE9, [grids](http://semantic-ui.com/collections/grid.html) and other [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes) components are not supported by IE9 and may not appear correctly.
